Code to replicate the simulations described in:
Karjus et al. 2018, "Challenges in detecting evolutionary forces in language change using diachronic corpora" (ArXiv e-print)
(run Wright-Fisher simulations with given parameters, bin the 
output into bins akin to those used in diachronic text corpora,
and apply the FIT (Feder et al. 2014), following Newberry et al. (2017))
 
Code: Andres Karjus
